# luckyblock
A lucky blocks plugin, but for Spigot! No need to install any client side mods for this one!
To use this plugin is simple. First you need a Minecraft server running Spigot, Bukkit, or paper 1.16.
Next download the jar.
Finally just put the jar into your plugins folder (on your server), and you're all done!
Restart your Minecraft server and the plugin should be loaded! Test it by doing the command /luckyblock to give yourself a luckyblock.
Break it, and see what happens!
